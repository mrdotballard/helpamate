# HelpAMate

Help A Mate is web app where you create different to-do style lists and your friends can view those lists and help you get stuff done. You require an account (authentication) to create lists, but your friends do not. All your list are public to varing degrees, according to your choosing. Simply add some questions specific to each list (which only certian friends should know), and they can access your list, tick of items, leave comments, or even add items if they answer the question correctly.

The main thought behind this is creating a way to have mates help you collaboritvly get things done without *yet another* account/login/passport...also a little fun for them to correctly answer your quetions in order to access your list(s).
